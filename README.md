## About the system:

A smart, web-based information system, built for the "Ramot-Yam" High School Learning Center in Michmoret. There are private lessons for students provided by the teachers, as well as other activities at the Learning Center.

The main purpose of this system is to make the assigning processes of the private lessons more efficient, taking into account systemic and personal constraints and generating business insights for optimization.

The system assists the Learning Center director to follow and monitor student progress, manage schedules of the center and center activities, privilege management, report generation, and finally assists in the decision-making process so each user has its own interface where he can perform actions relevant to him.

 

## Main features:
- Automatic system notifications

- Messaging system between an administrator and students / teachers

- System login - using a username and password

- User Management - administrator can edit / delete / add a student / teacher to the system

- Display schedules with user-specific activities

- Student Application Management – administrator  can reject / approve student requests for register / cancel the student's participation in the lesson

- Teachers Request Management - administrator  can reject / approve teachers requests for lessons cancellation

- System reports - Teachers hours report, student feedback, demand by subjects

- Producing feedback on students' progress - After each lesson, the teacher must fill in feedback on the students participated as well as mark which of the students who signed up was present and who did not.

- Eligibility Management - An administrator can deny eligibility for lessons at his or her discretion. In addition, the system automatically blocks students who have missed out lessons without notifying 3 times and updates the blocked student and administrator. The administrator can remove the student from the non-eligible list at any time. A blocked (ineligible) student cannot apply for lessons, his / her applications for enrollment in pending status are automatically rejected, and he / she is removed from all lessons to which he/she is registered (also automatically).

- Submit Enrollment Requests / Cancel Attendance - A student can submit a request to register / cancel participation in a lesson. The status request is pending until it will be approved by the administrator.

- Viewing Requests - A student / teacher can view their requests at any time and follow up their status
